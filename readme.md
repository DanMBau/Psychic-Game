This is a letter guessing game.

The user picks a letter and it gets compared to a randomly generated letter.
The goal is to guess the correct letter within 10 tries. For each correct guess a win counter gets increased by 1,
for 10 incorrect guesses in a row a loss counter gets increased by 1.
After each win the "guesses remaining" counter gets reset to 10
